# StarWarsAPI
## Getting Started 
Just open up the Index.html in your browser and everything should pop up if you have all the files. 

## Purpose
To show All Star Wars Movies and various Information about them. In the list view, there a couple of filters to help you.

The detail view gives some more information as well as a up/down vote feature. 

## Implementation
I choose to use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to build this application for easy re-rendering.
